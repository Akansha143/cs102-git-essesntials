Five git commands:
1] git push = to share your local commits by pushing them up to remote repository
2] git config = in this command ,you can specify a username and email address to be used by default whenever new commits are made.
3] git clone = it copies your entire git repository so you can work on copy impacting original one
4] git commit = use to take all the changes that have been made locally and push them to the remote repository
5] git status = that can check the changes made in your local repo.

What i have learn in todays lec:
1: first create a new repository
2: use cat .gitconfig or vim .config
3: we can chcek if our computer already have ssh key by ls -al~/.ssh|grep 'id_rsa'
4: NOW, Type cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub (copy the link and paste it on this path --> profile > settings > ssh and gpg key > new ssh key > copy paste and add description 
   THIS IS VERY IMP TO START CLONING.
5: FOR CLONING=
   Profile > your repo > click on repo you like to clone > click on "code" > copy the ssh link > go to ubuntu aand paste the link > add "git clone" in front of the link > Enter
6: Get into the directory, use git status > git remote -v (if this is not types the pull push will not work) > git status > "cat > filename" > git add . > git status > git commit -m > git push
